                            <h3>Zanzibar Island</h3>
                            <p>JSet like a jewel in tranquil coral waters, only 20 minutes flight from Dar es  Salaam, is one of the world‘s most beautiful islands – Zanzibar. Its name evokes a romantic past. To the shores of these islands came Sumerians, Assyrians, Hindus, Egyptians, Phoenicians, Arabians, Chinese, Malaysians, and the Portuguese, all sailing in on Monsoon winds. From these shores the great European explorers Burton, Speke, Livingstone, Krapf, Rebman, and Grant set out on their voyages of discovery into the East and Central African hinterland.

                                The different races that have settled in Zanzibar over the centuries have left an imprint on the people and the architecture. The “House of Wonders” and the narrow streets of the Old Stone Town are just some of the vivid reminders of the islands long and colored history. Zanzibar is also the birthplace of the fascinating Swahili culture with its elegant architecture, full of balconies, courtyards, hand-carved doors and mosques. For centuries the historic Spice Islands of Zanzibar has evoked a mystical and magical dream. 
                                Fascinating history, exotic spices, sandy beaches and hospitable people… this is the enchantment of Zanzibar.
                                 Different excursions are arranged while in Zanzibar.  These include taking visitors to spices plantations in 
                                 the countryside where a variety of seasonal spices, tropical fruits and medicinal herbs are grown. </p>
                            <p>Another popular excursion is the Zanzibar Stone Town Tour which is literary a travel into history of this old 
                                capital of the Omani Sultans.  Other excursions will include the old slave caves in Mangapwani, the prison island, 
                                ruins of what was the palace of the Sultan Said, the old slave market and \many other historical places.  Zanzibar is 
                                an archipelago consisting of two main islands of Unguja (also referred to as Zanzibar) and Pemba, and several other 
                                surrounding small islets.</p>
